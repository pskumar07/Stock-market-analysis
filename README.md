1. Overview

This app helps you predict future stock prices using smart computer models called machine learning.  
You can type in a stock symbol (like AAPL for Apple), choose a time period, and see predictions and charts in your web browser.  
It’s designed for anyone interested in stocks, whether you’re a beginner or have experience.

Technologies Used:  
- Python: The programming language used to build the app.  
- Streamlit: Lets you run the app in your browser with an easy interface.  
- scikit-learn: Provides tools for machine learning and predictions.  
- Pandas: Handles and organizes stock data.  
- Plotly: Draws interactive charts and graphs.  
- yfinance: Downloads stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Audience:  
Anyone curious about stocks, investing, or learning how computers can help predict prices.


2. Purpose / Objective

- Help users see possible future trends in stock prices  
- Teach how machine learning can be used for predictions  
- Make stock analysis easy and accessible for everyone  
- Provide a safe space to experiment with stock data without risking real money


3. System Requirements

Hardware:  
- Any computer with at least 4GB RAM (most modern computers are fine)

Software:  
- Python 3.8 or newer  
- The libraries listed below

Libraries / Dependencies:  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- plotly  
- numpy  
- yfinance  
- streamlit  
- openpyxl


4. Installation & Setup

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Python:  
   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install required libraries:

5. Features / Functionalities

- Input stock symbol: Type in the symbol for the stock you want to analyze (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
- Predict future stock prices: See predictions for the next few days based on recent trends.
- Display interactive prediction graphs: View colorful charts that you can zoom and hover over for details.
- View technical indicators: Learn about RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more—these help you understand stock movements.
- Download stock data as CSV: Save the data to your computer for your own analysis.
- Submit feedback via sidebar: Share your thoughts or suggestions directly in the app.

6. User Guide / Instructions

How to Use:

1. Start the app (`streamlit run main.py`)
2. Enter a stock symbol (for example: AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla)
3. Choose how much history you want to see (like 1 month, 1 year, etc.)
4. Click "Show Stock Data"
5. Explore the company info, prediction graphs, and technical indicators
6. Download the data or leave feedback if you want

Tips:
- Use the sidebar for quick stock suggestions.
- Hover over charts for more details.
- Expand each indicator section to learn what it means.

7. Technical Details / Workflow

How it works:

- Data Collection:  
  The app uses yfinance to get stock prices and company info from Yahoo Finance.

- Data Preprocessing:  
  The data is cleaned and organized using pandas. This includes removing missing values and calculating extra columns like moving averages.

- Machine Learning Model:  
  The app uses simple models (like Linear Regression) from scikit-learn to predict future prices based on recent trends.

- Visualization:  
  All results are shown as interactive charts using Plotly, so you can explore the data visually.

9. Troubleshooting

Common Problems & Solutions:

- Missing libraries:  
  If you see an error about a missing library, type `pip install ...` for the missing package.

- Wrong stock symbol:  
  Make sure you use a real symbol (like AAPL for Apple). If you’re not sure, check the sidebar for suggestions.

- No data returned:  
  Try a different symbol or time period. Some stocks may not have enough data.

- App won’t start:  
  Make sure you’re in the right folder and have installed all the libraries.
